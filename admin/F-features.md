In addition to the features that are auto-graded, the graphical user interface
of our project implements the following features:

*(Remove those that are unimplemented)*

 - A simple placement viewer (Task 4)
 - A basic playable game
 - A basic playable game that snaps pieces to the board, allows rotation, HOWEVER does NOT check for validity (Task 7)
 - Generates simple challenges with buttons (Task 9)
 - Finds solutions to challenges (Task 10) - Done with slow complexity

additional features...

 - Intuitive controls: click to rotate, and drag to place.
 - Piece class Objects that store ImageView of the piece, as well as physical properties of the piece (Location, orientation)
 - An "Replay" button that resets the current challenge (removes any pieces you placed from the board)
 - Instructions on the right hand side of the window
